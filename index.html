                    home, gourmet meal ordering, medical requests, educational material about their treatments and much
                    more. You can triage requests to reduce the pressure on your teams, and prioritise the care given by
                    doctors and nurses, so patients are always tended to in good time. This in-room system is already used by the world's top hotel brands, but the concept is
                    unrivalled across the healthcare industry. Wouldn't you like your facility to stand out as the one that gives
                    patients total comfort and control during their stay?</p2>  </BR>
